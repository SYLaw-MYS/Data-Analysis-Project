## Introduction


An SQL analysis of a company's trended performance data, telling the story of the company's growth, can help the CEO craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth. Analysing the traffic and website performance data is important in order to show how the company able to produce growth. By diving in to the marketing channel activities and the website improvements that have contributed to the company success to date, it can show to the stakeholder that the company is a serious data-driven shop.

Data visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and pandas enable a more efficient way to correlate the operations to the company's performance improvement just in a glance. 

Lastly, data modelling with machine learning method help the company in making decision what operations can result in better company's performance by predicting its potential sales.

### Datasets used
The dataset provided with the MySQL Advanced Course by [Maven](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/) analyzed the sales of Maven Fuzzy Factory, and was specifically adjusted for the Bootcamp in 2022 from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/) to aid students practice SQL skills with a project. 

We will be working with six related tables, which contain eCommerce data about:
+ Website Activity
+ Products
+ Orders and Refunds
We will use MySQL to understand how customers access and interact with the site, analyse landing page performance and conversion, and explore product-level sales.
